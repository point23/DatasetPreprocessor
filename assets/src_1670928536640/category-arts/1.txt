Sometimes the most mundane of actions can serve as impetus for
art transforming a simple gesture into a mesmerizing visual feast
Take for example Claire Droppert s series Sand Creatures Whilst
at our local beach in the Netherlands I saw my
daughter playing and kicking sand up in the air Droppert
explained to HuffPost As she did this I noticed the
sunlight shine through and the resulting effect looked gorgeous As
gravity and light took control I saw shapes of sand
creatures being created Hare And so a photography project was
born Using a DSLR camera a tripod and the sandy
expanses of a beach Droppert creates gravity defying creatures that
exist only for a moment memorialized by her quick shutter
She simply shovels and tosses sand and before her very
eyes abstract figures and geometric forms take shape Liken the
process to cloud gazing just as we stare at the
skies willing cumulonimbus and altostratus to resemble rabbits and smiling
faces Droppert stares into the ethereal sand configurations and sees
bodies and limbs I m fascinated by nature I enjoy
observing and being part of my surroundings she explained Sand
Creatures is part of my Gravity project Within this project
I wanted to capture the Earth s different elements sand
light wind etc and let them stand out in their
natural environment The result is a moment frozen in time
one that appears so pristine we wonder if it ever
happened Check out the entire Sand Creatures series below and
