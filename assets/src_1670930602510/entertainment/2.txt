When Eileen Ford died this week I sent a condolence email
to one of her closest friends the legendary model Carmen
Dell Orefice Carmen starred in my doc About Face Supermodels
Then and Now and was in my studio the day
Eileen sat for her interview for the film Carmen wrote
back with her thoughts on Eileen and I persuaded her
to allow me to post her words here Photo Timothy
Greenfield Sanders Studio Eileen Ford was foremost a mother who
lived and applied her classic values to everything to which
she put her heart and mind She was a visionary
In 1947 Eileen started The Ford Model Agency a service
to take care of young models putting us together with
legitimate clients and making sure we were properly and respectfully
treated and financially compensated It was that year that she
took me under her wing I was 16 years old
Eileen Ford was a liberated woman decades before women s
lib Her visionary ideas started a dynasty in partnership with
her devoted husband Jerry who was squarely behind her all
the way until his untimely death several years ago They
loved each other so much that they even renewed their
marriage vows some 50 years after their wedding Eileen single
mindedly gave birth to a new industry All who came
after her could not equal her achievements only emulate The
life of any model lucky enough to be accepted at
Ford under Eileen s mentorship was one way or another
altered for the better She held sacred her family her
friends and life itself Thank you Eileen and Jerry for
the legacy of your four children and their children living
forward their way Thank you for your strong human values
You will always be remembered by me with loving gratitude
for all you have brought into my life since 1947
