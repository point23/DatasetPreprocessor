 WARNING Contains spoilers Please do not read on unless you
ve seen the premiere episode of American Horror Story Freak
Show titled Monsters Among Us Or if you don t
mind spoilers go right ahead You know what they say
Florida is where the weirdest things happen That certainly seems
to be the case on American Horror Story Freak Show
the premiere was all sorts of bats t crazy and
despite its setting back in idyllic 1952 Jupiter Florida the
cookie cutter square box stereotypes of that era have absolutely
no place here They never do on AHS which I
m pleased to report has once again upped the intensity
the insanity and the outright what the f kness of
the whole franchise yet again with Freak Show Things get
nuts and they get there quickly Freak Show is not
the slow burn that was Coven Instead Freak Show has
more of a whiplash chaotic feel almost as if you
re wandering the carnival midway with flashes of colour in
your vision and loud noises all around you You can
t tell where to look but man when you catch
a glimpse it sticks with you From Evan Peters Lobster
Boy sex hands to Meryl Streep Jr s opium infused
orgy to Jessica Lange s acid trip singing performance Freak
Show is like absolute crack for true fans AHS lunatics
should dig this right from the start as soon as
we see Jessica Lange strutting into the hospital with her
omnipresent cigarette her Cruella de Vil furs her hat and
that walk We missed you Ms Lange And how enjoyable
was the big slow reveal of Sarah Paulson s expertly
played Bette and Dot Sure we all knew it was
coming but they tantalized us by describing her inner organs
showing her feet then revealing one head then finally two
I will admit in the off season I had some
fears about Paulson s character Would it be too gimmicky
I was quickly relieved to see that Murphy and Falchuk
chose to have fun with the concept rather than just
splay it out there as a water cooler item Side
note This is where Coven veered off course Too many
far out gimmicks without any concrete tie ins to plot
or consistency More fun is had when the cameras shoot
from one head s perspective or when they split the
shot so we can see what Bette and Dot individually
see For her part s Paulson nails it again just
as she does in every season of AHS She s
instantly the most interesting character s and the dichotomous personalities
of the two heads are a fantastic final touch The
other AHS veteran Peters certainly got short changed in Coven
as the gutteral Kyle but this season s Jimmy Darling
might be Peters best character yet He s rocking the
ducktail hair and his Lobster Boy hands certainly have their
ahem uses I enjoyed one two minute scene with Jimmy
more than an entire season of Kyle He has a
lot going on too feelings of being trapped in the
circus resentment towards Elsa Lange his underground sex services to
pent up 50s housewives his desire to be more than
just a freak his war against the townspeople which should
be interesting when it ramps up and his relationship with
his mother Ethel Kathy Bates as a subdued line toeing
bearded lady It was nice to not have the desire
to change the channel when he wandered onscreen Of course
not everything on AHS can be sunshine and lollipops Freak
Show is ultimately the tale of a bunch of misfits
people with deformities finding safety and comfort amongst their own
As we saw on Coven AHS thrives when it pits
an ostracized group against an established one In this particular
case if I may use a Family Guy term it
s the normies vs the freaks The whole idea hammered
home a bit too literally and frequently by Lange Peters
and Bates show don t tell guys c mon is
that the normies and freaks will be inverted and the
true ugliness of the civilized will shine through while the
freaks will be the righteous victors I wonder if AHS
Freak Show will eventually subvert that subversion as the season
goes on and have the monsters truly become monsters Elsa
as head honcho is only out for her own fame
as we discover at the end of the episode and
will use anyone to get it And that cop stabbing
mutilation scene with Jimmy inspiring his army is indicative of
some serious repercussions for the townspeople Let s not forget
the elephant in the room or rather the hideous terrifying
clown on the show Twisty Ever since the days of
Pennywise the Clown in Stephen King s It clowns have
been more frightening than entertaining Freak Show once again ups
the ante with Twisty s mask which could very well
be his torn up face his dirty stained costume and
that godawful stare I swear I caught myself having to
look away from the TV Maybe I m just a
wimp but when Twisty taunts the teenage girl and the
little boy in the cages it was like torture for
us the viewer I kept thinking when is this going
to end Stop banging on the cages Oh God what
is he pulling out of his pocket There s also
something about incessant chest stabbing which we also saw before
on Coven that is particularly unnerving I m interested to
see if Twisty joins up with the freak show or
if he uses their battle for his own selfish disturbing
purposes In true fashion Freak Show closes its premiere with
a touching well shot scene of Elsa revealing her own
freak quality her lack of legs We d spent the
whole episode thinking that Lange s character was a madam
of sorts not actually one of the circus members But
we see in one fell swoop why she s not
a 1950 s Hollywood star but also why she s
so motivated to keep her freak show up and running
It s all she has and it s all she
lives for Well that and subjecting unsuspecting candy stripers to
the mind altering effects of opium Until next week when
I hear things get even crazier P S it s
lovely to be back AHS fans Thank you for having
me Not like you had a choice Freak Of The
Week I m loving everyone from Jyoti Amge to the
tattooed British guy but this week s freak has to
be Bette and Dot Just as they re the headliner
head get it of the freak show they re the
headliner of Freak Show It s impossible to look away
when she s they re on screen Random Thoughts I
want to issue an important disclaimer going forward I have
a lot of discomfort using the word freak as a
descriptor but for lack of a better word it s
how I will be referring to the circus member characters
I mean NO offence to anyone but am simply using
the show s lexicon because it s easier I didn
t mention anything about Frances Conroy s character Gloria Mott
She s back to chewing the scenery this season which
is how I love my Conroy Just give her some
ridiculous gloves and a wig and it s off to
the races At first I thought there were two Peppers
but then realized it s a boy Pepper and a
girl Pepper I hope his name isn t Salt That
would be too much As in Coven the colours and
scenery of the southern U S are gorgeous I know
AHS super saturates everything but it really adds to the
fantastical and dreamlike quality of this series Also loved the
close ups of the 50s food which looked in a
word revolting D licious D livery Loved when Bette inhaled
the cigarette and Dot exhaled SO FUN I haven t
seen that much blue eyeshadow since the 80s Elsa I
am not a prude at all but when Evan Peters
had those housewives lining up for his shocking services and
then they showed almost all of it happening I was
floored The graphic sexuality adds a whole other element to
the show Here s hoping no one decided to let
their kids watch this or else they re answering a
lot of questions right about now American Horror Story Freak
