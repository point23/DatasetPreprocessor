The San Francisco Zoo is on an apparent mission to inundate
you with baby animal cuteness To wrap up a banner
year of newborns the zoo is finally revealing the baby
gorilla born in July Her name Kabibe is Swahili for
little lady For the past five months the zoo has
been carefully transitioning her care from the staff over to
her western lowland gorilla family According to a press release
from the zoo matriarch grandma Bawang jumped into action as
the infant s adoptive mother supervising her introductions to the
other gorillas in the troop Once again Bawang has taken
on the huge responsibility of motherhood and has set a
positive tone for the troop San Francisco Zoo President Tanya
Peterson said We feel very blessed to be able to
contribute to the population of this critically endangered species and
we feel especially grateful to introduce the entire gorilla family
to the public during this holiday season The public will
be able to view Kabibe on Saturday but we have
a few sneak peak photos below All photos by Marianne
