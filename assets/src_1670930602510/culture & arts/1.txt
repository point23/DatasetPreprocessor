I went out with a camera and avoided any copyright infractions
by running outside onto public property to discuss the work

galleries This was all recorded on the brisk but sunny
Southern California afternoon of March 15 2012 All of these

Judy Chicago Nye and Brown Camille Rose Garcia Michael Kohn
Gallery Hadley Holliday Taylor De Cordoba Carolyn Casta o Walter
Maciel Rosson Crowe Honor Fraser Blum Poe Gallery Luis De
Jesus Gallery Cherry and Martin Gallery I can also recommend
Delia Brown s show at Angles Gallery my review of
