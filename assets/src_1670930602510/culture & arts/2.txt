You d think that the World Day of Action for Pussy
Riot held on the day of their sentencing no one
ever imagined they wouldn t be convicted by the Russian
court would bring a crowd of outraged artists at the
world s largest Fringe Festival into the streets After all
there are over 2 600 shows at the Fringe So
it was a bit surreal to find only 35 people
in the audience for the only action taking place in
their behalf in Edinburgh Now to be fair I am
not an investigative journalist and perhaps there were other meetings
being held elsewhere at Fringe but if there were they
were so small as to be insignificant Which raises the
question was this gathering so small as to be insignificant
First some perspective it is almost impossible to publicize anything
well in the middle of the Fringe without a highly
paid publicist Edinburgh is like a 127 ring circus and
the press has gone all overwhelmed and A D D
at the same time So many shiny people So many
stunts and sideshows Look over there somebody s eating a
sword and breathing fire at the same time with help
from a dance company from Beijing And the good people
who put this event together at the last minute were
not promoters at any of the big venues the ones
with dozens of press agents hanging around looking for crumbs
of news about George Wendt or David Hasslehoff No the
good people who put this event together were gathered at
a smaller newer venue in a quieter section of town
the Sweet Venues in the Grassmarket The Grassmarket reminds me
a bit of Strawberry Fields in Central Park crossed with
Boston Common but bite sized Edinburgh s street names tell
its history and the Cowgate is a long narrow street
that leads to the Grassmarket So that all makes sense
On either side of the rectangle of grass are shops
and many many small restaurants If you look up at
the right spot you get a spectacular look straight up
a cliff to Edinburgh Castle The air here is more
relaxed Nobody s thrusting flyers in your hands every two
feet There s space and room to breathe and have
a beer and a snack The Sweet Venues have four
theaters carved out of areas from the International Hotel with
a wide variety of Fringey things music theater even magic
acts At Edinburgh Fringe each Venue curates its own mini
festival and all these added together with the free festivals
become the Fringe The Pussy Riot event was hosted by
Sweet Venues because their Venue Manager director JD Henshaw decided
the event was a necessary thing for somebody to do
at the Fringe so he worked with a few people
and just did it Three young actresses from the Tit
for Tat Theater came on the small stage at Sweet
Venue s Theater Four an hour before the verdicts were
handed down and each one spoke from actual testimony given
by the women of Pussy Riot on trial They spoke
simply without any attempt at acting using a translation made
by the poet Sasha Dugdale Sasha made the translation available
to playwright EV Crowe in London the Royal Court Theatre
was having the same readings at the same time as
our little group at the Fringe The first actress to
speak read the words of Nadya Tolokonnikova from her testimony
on August 8th in the Khaminochevsky Court It is not
really Pussy Riot vocalists who are on trial here If
that were the case then what happened would have no
significance On trial here is the state system of the
Russian Federation And there was that word again significance It
threw me back into the early days of the AIDS
Coalition to Unleash Power otherwise known as ACT Up begun
by playwright activist Larry Kramer and many others I wasn
t part of it but knew people who were and
some of them didn t live to see the new
drug cocktail that their actions pushed into quicker clinical trials
It threw me back to the playwright activist who became
his country s president Vaclav Havel Few people recall what
started Havel on his way to national prominence in 1976
a Czech rock band called The Plastic People of the
Universe were arrested for the crime of rock and roll
The movement that grew up around this outrage was called
the Charter 77 Movement for Human Rights and the spokesman
was a playwright named Vaclav Havel A few years ago
Tom Stoppard s play Rock and Roll was on Broadway
and I took my daughter to see it She liked
it but wasn t moved by it She didn t
know the history of the Plastic People of the Universe
the crushing totalitarian nature of the old style Soviet system
was already a dim memory hardly discussed even in college
courses What is that clich about the need to remember
our history The Edinburgh Fringe Festival held an event in
solidarity with the Pussy Riot artists yesterday About 35 people
attended About 10 took part in the direct organization and
performance Was it significant I attended a discussion at Fringe
Central last week about the ways art and political action
can be intertwined The fact that a group of people
in the middle of a mad attempt to create art
without going bankrupt took time out to talk about politics
and arts was a good sign Thoughtful people said thoughtful
things We like to believe that our work is more
than just for laughs or entertainment There are plays in
Edinburgh about every possible social issue the rights of women
gays workers plays pointing to oppressive social orders and dream
killing regimes You could spend your days here seeing nothing
but young comics making jokes about tits and testicles or
you could spend your time seeing what makes you think
feel and yes on occasion laugh One of those plays
is about gay marriage that s mine Is any of
it significant We sure as hell hope it is
