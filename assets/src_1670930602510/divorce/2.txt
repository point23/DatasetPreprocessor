Divorce is one of the most traumatic events that anyone can
go through in his or her lifetime Not only is
it frightening but it s difficult to say the least
even under the best of circumstances Attorneys and clients usually
have a love hate relationship during a divorce Typically clients
will need an attorney at the beginning of the case
but by the end of the divorce in many circumstances
the client s attitude sometimes justifiably is that the attorney
didn t do enough for them I m not happy
with your services and for these reasons I don t
want to pay your bill Think of this scenario A
person going through a divorce is in a no win
situation First of all you don t see your children
all the time even under the best of circumstances where
custodial arrangements range from one parent having primary physical custody
and the other parent having very limited time to a
50 50 arrangement So no matter how you look at
it you will spend less time with your children Second
one party is paying child support the other party is
receiving child support and when you split up and set
up two separate households too often there is not enough
money to go around Third in many cases there is
spousal support which again cuts the marital pie Fourth there
are the issues of property it is divided You now
have half of what you had you often have more
debts and to say the least it is too frequently
a lose lose situation Attorneys end up helping people divide
debts as they have fewer assets smaller retirement accounts and
houses that are under water Finally to add insult to
injury you have to pay your attorney So from this
attorney s perspective what makes a good client 1 Try
to be organized When you are meeting with your attorney
write down your questions in advance Try to have an
agenda and make sure that your attorney answers your questions
2 Do not call or e mail continually because this
is how your case will start spinning out of control
from a cost standpoint Most attorneys charge by the hour
and we are not only charging for phone calls but
also for e mails because e mail has now become
the preferred method of communication I find that I have
almost no snail mail in my cases and everything is
done electronically Save up your questions If you are going
to communicate by e mail or phone have several questions
at once rather than doing one now one later and
having a bombardment of e mails back and forth on
a daily basis which happens too frequently in cases that
are spinning out of control 3 Remember that an attorney
is here to assist you and help you through the
legal system Do not be afraid to feel lost and
bewildered but make sure that you and your attorney are
communicating A good client will ask questions but not too
many 4 Have reasonable expectations Be realistic A good attorney
will help you stay reality oriented Listen to your attorney
Listen to legal advice Remember that you are trying to
resolve issues not have a war 5 Try to be
reasonable Don t ask for something that you are not
going get Bear in mind that in negotiations you should
always ask for more than you expect to receive but
don t be off the wall Have realistic expectations regarding
custody and parenting time Try to be realistic about child
support and spousal support Try to be realistic about property
division 6 Too many clients want the house no matter
what Yes there is often an emotional attachment but in
many cases especially if the economics make no sense it
is better to not keep the house Sometimes it is
better to sell it sometimes it s better for the
spouse who has a greater income to keep it These
are all things to consider 7 Have a game plan
and an agenda but be prepared to be flexible Remember
that life happens and if things didn t go wrong
in your life you wouldn t be getting a divorce
in the first place 8 Work with a therapist This
is important because often there are anger issues or feelings
of loss or resentment Your attorney is not your therapist
9 Try to have your attorney explain the legal system
to you so you know what to expect 10 It
is important to assist your attorney as far as providing
documents and information because the more helpful you can be
the more cost effective your attorney can be and the
lower your attorney fees will be 11 Don t hesitate
to discuss fees to ask about how much the representation
will cost and do not hesitate to request a monthly
billing statement so you know exactly what is going on
with regard to billings in your case 12 Last but
not least remember that divorce is a process a transition
albeit a painful one but it is a step that
you will get through I often tell my clients to
think of a 100 yard dash That is not a
divorce A divorce is more like a marathon and if
you start understanding that you will get through it You
will also be a better client and you will understand
that there is light at the end of the tunnel
