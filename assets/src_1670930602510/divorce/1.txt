I m not sure I ve ever met anyone who really
enjoys first dates First dates especially when it pertains to
dating after divorce can be awkward uncomfortable boring weird or
just plain awful Do I have food in my teeth
Is this guy really interested in anything I m saying
Is he cute I can t decide Does she seem
a little too bitter about her ex husband Does he
think I m fat Was he disappointed when he came
to the door Does this girl like me These are
some of the questions going through the minds of men
and women on first dates If you want to increase
your changes of success on a first date here are
five things not to do They might make the difference
when it comes to making plans for date number two
versus experiencing a first date flop 1 Don t eat
like a bird This is all part of being yourself
If you like to eat and or if you are
hungry just eat If you pick at your food one
of three things will happen One your date will think
you don t like the meal two he or she
will feel uncomfortable because they are eating and you re
not or three you will be perceived as having an
eating disorder 2 Don t keep checking your iPhone Put
the thing in your purse and keep it there If
this person is investing his or her time to go
out for dinner with you he or she deserves your
full attention You can text your friends when you get
home Exception If you have kids and you have a
new babysitter you can keep the phone out but tell
your date that s the reason it s out 3
Don t pay for dinner This is for women Make
the guy feel like the guy by paying If you
offer to pay the first time you go out he
will probably be disappointed and feel less manly My rule
of thumb is offer insist actually on paying on the
fourth date or make him dinner for the fourth date
I do think it s okay to pay for a
Coke for him if you go to a movie afterwards
or pay for a round of drinks if you go
to a bar That s just a nice gesture 4
Don t talk about your last relationship OR your ex
Trust me on this one He or she might ask
you about your divorce and it s okay to give
a brief not too emotional summation of what happened but
stop there Trust me Don t say He s a
jerk or she s psychotic or I hope he burns
in hell and don t provide details about cheating fighting
and all of your ex s faults If you do
you will have this person running away so fast your
head will spin 5 Don t have sex A friend
of mine would completely disagree and say that I m
living in the 50s but the reason I feel this
way isn t just because the guy will think you
re easy He might not even think that These days
it seems like sex on a first date isn t
that big of a deal which makes me sad in
a way Here s my reasoning behind saving the sex
for down the road I think it s a good
thing to let the new relationship breathe Get to know
each other and let the attraction build Kissing is fun
and sexy so just do that If you wait just
a little while it will be so much better and
will mean more First Date Red Flags If he or
she does any of these dump the person fast 1
If he or she orders several cocktails more than three
on the date dump him or her 2 If he
or she keeps checking their iPhone dump him or her
3 For women If he starts talking dirty alluding to
how great the sex with you is going to be
dump him 4 For women If he gets the bill
and questions the waiter about something on it or thinks
the amount is incorrect dump him Guys you can t
really worry about the check being perfectly correct on a
first date You just can t Jackie Pilossoph is the
