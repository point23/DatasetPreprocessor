Secretary Arne Duncan has frequently pointed to the high test scores
of students in South Korea as a model for American
students to copy We have heard again and again that
we are losing the global competition to nations like South
Korea where students and parents take tests very seriously Our
students the secretary never tires of telling us are slackers
Their parents want them to be well rounded when they
should all be enrolled in Advanced Placement courses burning the
midnight oil or attending after school programs in ever longer
school days On Sunday the New York Times published an
article that refuted the myth of South Korea as the
acme of educational excellence The South Korean system the author
writes is an assault upon our children If all you
care about is test scores South Korean schools look great
But if you want students who are thoughtful creative and
engaged in their learning look elsewhere writes Se Woong Koo
whose family moved from Seoul to Vancouver to avoid the
stress of South Korean schooling Most parents pressure students to
excel in their studies and to do whatever it takes
to get high scores Thirteen years later in 2008 the
author writes I taught advanced English grammar to 11 year
olds at an expensive cram school in the wealthy Seoul
neighborhood of Gangnam The students were serious about studying but
their eyes appeared dead The world may look to South
Korea as a model for education its students rank among
the best on international education tests but the system s
dark side casts a long shadow Dominated by Tiger Moms
cram schools and highly authoritarian teachers South Korean education produces
ranks of overachieving students who pay a stiff price in
health and happiness The entire program amounts to child abuse
It should be reformed and restructured without delay Cram schools
like the one I taught in known as hagwons in
Korean are a mainstay of the South Korean education system
and a symbol of parental yearning to see their children
succeed at all costs Hagwons are soulless facilities with room
after room divided by thin walls lit by long fluorescent
bulbs and stuffed with students memorizing English vocabulary Korean grammar
rules and math formulas Students typically stay after regular school
hours until 10 p m or later This investment in
education is what has been used to explain South Koreans
spectacular scores on the Program for International Student Assessment increasingly
the standard by which students from all over the world
are compared to one another But a system driven by
overzealous parents and a leviathan private industry is unsustainable over
the long run especially given the physical and psychological costs
that students are forced to bear Many young South Koreans
suffer physical symptoms of academic stress like my brother did
In a typical case one friend reported losing clumps of
hair as she focused on her studies in high school
her hair regrew only when she entered college The South
Korean system is institutionalized child abuse Children exist either to
glorify the family or to build the national economy What
has been sacrificed The happiness of the children the right
to live a normal life in which they are not
cogs in a national economic machine Are you listening Secretary
Duncan Are you listening New York Times columnists and editorial
board Are you listening television pundits
