looks at how to pick the best student loan repayment
plan for you Federal Student Loan Income Driven Repayment Plans
If you have a federal student loan your monthly repayments
may depend on your discretionary income which is defined as
the amount by which your adjusted gross income exceeds the
poverty line The most common are Income Based Pay 10
15 of your discretionary income over a 25 year term
Pay As You Earn Pay 10 of your discretionary income
over a 20 year term Income Contingent Pay the lesser
of two options being 20 of your income over a
25 year term or a fixed amount over a 12
year term Another advantage of income driven repayment plans is
that once you finish the stipulated repayment term all remaining
student debt is forgiven Prepayment On Federal Student Loans If
you have sufficient income you may be able to repay
your student loans early This gives you the benefit of
paying less over the life of your student loans as
less interest will accrue For instance if you have a
200 per month loan repayment but you pay 250 instead
the extra 50 can go towards reducing the principal of
the loan minimizing future interest As best practice make sure
you communicate in writing with your lender about any prepayment
to be sure that it goes towards paying off the
loan principal and not towards your next loan payment Reducing
Federal Student Loan Interest Rates Looking for lower interest rates
on student loans can be a good strategy but there
are several important factors to consider For example the Standard
Repayment Plan for federal student loans provides the shortest repayment
term however repayments start at a fixed amount of at
least 50 per month For federal student loan repayment plans
generally if you make higher repayments each month i e
prepay less total interest will accrue potentially resulting in significant
savings over the life of the loan Student Loan Deferment
Deferment of a student loan means that you are given
extra time before you start making repayments for example during
the first year after graduation while you search for full
time employment Other reasons for deferment might include illness further
education major injuries or unemployment Keep in mind that interest
on the student loan continues to accumulate during deferment making
your total overall repayments more costly except in the case
of certain federal loans such as Perkins Loans and Federal
Subsidized Loans Deferment may be beneficial if your income grows
substantially within a few years and repayment is difficult in
the short term However in most cases deferment results in
an increased total debt burden if interest accrues during this
period While almost all student loans can potentially be refinanced
it s important to be aware that refinancing your federal
student loans may result in the loss of certain federal
protections and benefits To see how much you can save
