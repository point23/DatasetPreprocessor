We live in a dangerous world Too many parents are willing
to stick their head in the sand and avoid sensitive
subjects at all costs because they re uncomfortable discussing it
with their children Most of us however are not We
protect our children by doing and saying everything that we
feel will keep them from harm s way SCOPE a
paid for afterschool program in Suffolk County NY decided that
some discussions are not worth having Or for that matter
safety measures and lockdown procedures policies are also not necessary
until they are government mandated GiGi Kearns a beloved SCOPE
teacher was fired last week after 14 years with the
program Here s what we believe based on what we
know SCOPE appears to have decided at relatively close to
the last minute right before a government mandate was pending
to ask all within their after school program to do
a lockdown practice They provided no policy or clear direction
on what or how to impose the lockdown i e
what do you do if all the security guards are
gone at the school GiGi a former NYPD officer a
comforting and constant presence and a childcare teacher who has
been beloved by parents and children alike implemented the procedure
in our grammar school My son along with a few
others were misbehaving GiGi quietly pulled them aside and emphasized
to them why it was very important to follow their
directions One child brought up Sandy Hook She responded explaining
that a bad man can come into a school and
hurt others and how important it is to trust your
teachers She showed them a picture of Adam Lanza and
photos of the parents outside of the school And that
was that My son came home and asked me what
Sandy Hook was and I told him I also told
him it s important to listen to your teachers and
not misbehave in these circumstances and that several teachers in
Sandy Hook were heroes who saved several lives that could
also have been lost had it not been for them
Unfortunately ONE parent in our school did not feel the
same ONE parent out of dozens took this incident to
the Principal then the head of the SCOPE program Without
any thorough investigation discussion with any other parents and very
likely reacting with fear that their organization s sloppiness in
not providing procedures and policies for the lockdown would be
outed used GiGi as their scapegoat and unceremoniously fired her
Over 300 parents signed a petition to reinstate GiGi including
countless calls and emails to Assistant Director Michael O Brien
and Director George Duffy Responses from Mr Duffy have been
non existent and emails back from Mr O Brien have
been curt and dismissive So the overriding message to teachers
and childcare workers from administrators who like ours have no
contact with the children and very rarely with the workers
who care for them day after day for very little
pay is if a child asks about Sandy Hook ignore
them or lose your job Why was she REALLY fired
Maybe SCOPE administrators feared their lack of policy would come
back to bite them Maybe they were looking for a
way to get rid of some of their older employees
and this provided them their out Maybe these administrators who
are paid very well for a not for profit are
thinking more about their own jobs and the skeletons in
their closets and in their panic decided to abolish the
situation the way they do with most things with a
knee jerk reaction What really happened We the parents do
not know SCOPE will not talk to us about this
decision at all Teachers have to be allowed to teach
and sensitive subjects must be allowed to be breached Sandy
Hook was a tragic event that no one wishes to
see happen again but we should also never forget Our
world has become so lawsuit conscious and so politically correct
that truth candor and life lessons have also become casualties
in our society s effort to sweep everything under the
rug when a few ultra sensitive people feel uncomfortable It
cannot happen We support GiGi and want her back If
you agree let us know
