 Illustration by Eliane Gerrits Last week our local elementary school
received a disturbing phone call In a pre recorded voice
the speaker said that he was armed and preparing to
attack the school The local SWAT team was on the
scene almost before the call ended In Holland we have
SWAT teams too Special Weapons and Tactics but they are
more familiar here thanks to Ferguson and now Baltimore Soon
they were swarming around the school squads of men in
military fatigues black helmets goggles radios and carrying rifles and
assault weapons Over the loudspeaker crackled the command Shelter in
Place Within seconds the kids were carrying out what they
had learned in many safety drills They stood with their
backs against the outside walls out of sight from the
windows Teachers closed the doors and windows and shut off
the lights The school looked empty It says something about
our times that we are learning a strange new vocabulary
to describe threats we can barely grasp While the little
kids huddled in Shelter in Place my kids at their
nearby schools were told Closed Campus That meant that no
one could enter or leave the premises Via text messages
on their cell phones they quickly realized that this was
not a drill they were threatened by an Active Shooter
Two hours later I received the following email message from
the principal Dear parents this morning we received a report
that an armed individual threatened our children Police have investigated
and suspects that it is a swatting hoax Someone sends
a message to an institution with a false message that
there is a serious threat so the SWAT team goes
into action Our school has followed all the correct procedures
according to the protocol of the police We want to
thank the police and staff for their adequate response to
events We all worked together to ensure the safety of
your child The police will continue to be alert in
the neighborhood but you can be assured that we continue
the day in a calm and productive learning environment I
was hardly reassured It had the same chilling effect on
me as the first scenes of the propaganda film Duck
and Cover It was released in 1951 by American Federal
Civil Defense Administration in consultation with Security Committee of the
National Education Association Maybe you ve seen it It begins
with a cartoon of a turtle named Bert cheerfully walking
down a street A monkey is dangling a firecracker with
a smoking fuse above his head It explodes but Bert
has already ducked and covered in his shell Bert nothing
will happen because he knows that he only needs to
listen to the government What applies to Bert as the
narrator explains applies to us all We are safe as
long as we listen to the instructions provided over all
the telephones The kids of the 1950s did not have
to worry about nuclear explosions it seems since the instruction
to Duck and Cover would protect them All the children
would have to do is crouch under their desks with
their hands above the heads Duck and Cover would have
to protect them from a nuclear bomb Today my kids
learn to deal with equally senseless attacks and murderous individuals
Once again the vocabulary of measurement is dusted off They
practice the difference between Code Red Code Green and Code
Yellow and the instructions Lockdown Closedown Closed Campus and Shelter
in Place We wrap them in a warm blanket of
nouns to protect them from danger like chanting magical spells
That night I lie awake I see images floating in
front of me of the Sandy Hook Elementary School in
Newtown CT where in 2012 an armed man invaded and
within five minutes shot dead 26 people The Lockdown procedure
the kids had practiced the week before tragically worked in
favor of the killer They were caught in a trap
