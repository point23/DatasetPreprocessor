LINDSAY CEPHAS FOR FATE FOTOS LLC During the Q A section
of a panel I was on a few months ago
a person in the audience made the requisite I m
not on the panel but I m gonna stand here
and hijack the panel conversation five minute pre question statement
some people at panels have the tendency to do and
then asked the single dumbest question I d ever heard
in my life So what about blue lives Do they
matter It was time to go Echoing the sentiment expressed
by the question voiced at the panel a nine year
old boy recently organized a Blue Lives Matter March just
outside of Chicago Illinois I suspect this child is the
victim of what Bomani Jones calls insufficient daddyin Each time
I hear a person say blue lives matter I walk
away with a lower estimation of their critical thinking abilities
They have clearly not thought through the logical implications of
the statement So before you embarrass yourself by asking a
similar question to a panelist go on Facebook and post
something trifling or organize a march to put on blast
just how insufficient you are in your thinking let me
explain why you should never say blue lives matter 1
It s a logical fallacy aka you sound dumb as
hell Look When you say Blue lives matter in response
to Black lives matter you re treating the former as
though it is the same as the latter That is
as though blue lives are equivalent to Black lives I
get it You mean to say that those who wear
blue as a symbol of their occupation matter They do
but here is the problem blue lives whatever the hell
that means and Black lives are not the same A
false equivalence is describing a situation where there appears to
be a logical and apparent equivalence but when in fact
there is none In other words you say something comparing
two things when there is in reality no comparison Yes
people who wear blue matter Postal Workers folks in the
United States Air Force Snoop Dogg University of North Carolina
Tarheels and police officers matter But to say that the
lives of people choosing to wear blue is the same
as those whose histories and existential experiences are colored daily
by the fact that they inhabit Black bodies is about
as dumb as saying that the five best rappers in
the game are Dylan Dylan Dylan Dylan and Dylan cuz
he spits hot fire 2 It s rooted in anti
blackness aka you sound racist as hell Like All Lives
Matter Blue Lives Matter is a reactionary statement It s
an attempt to refute a claim to dignity made by
those who proclaim that Black Lives matter Yet unlike Black
Lives Matter no one feels compelled to say the adjective
all in response to blue Why Easy answer anti Blackness
There is a deeply rooted flippancy toward the concerns of
Black people in this country and the statement blue lives
matter is an American original The statement reminds me of
the use of the Confederate Flag in response to the
Civil Rights movement It is an attempt to silence the
voices of Black people If real recognize real then Donald
Trump is looking at you like y all on a
first name basis 3 They don t exist aka what
the hell are you talking about With all due respect
which means I m about to say some disrespectful ish
what the hell are you talking about Seriously What the
hell is a blue life Do me a favor if
you ever run across a blue life kill it Don
t hesitate Sentient blue beings are not supposed to exist
unless this is Avatar And even in that movie White
folks were outchea on that genocide so blue lives didn
t even matter then When the person in the audience
asked that question I couldn t wait to respond I
leaned forward and said Thank you for you question but
blue lives don t matter After a gasp from the
audience I added Because they don t exist I would
have dropped the mic but it was attached to a
stand This piece originally appeared at VerySmartBrothers com RELATED BLACK
